# NFT-Marketplace-with-AR-Support
This project, explores the intersection of blockchain and immersive technologies. We developed a decentralized NFT marketplace that enables:
* NFT Minting & Sales: Users can mint unique NFTs on the Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts (Solidity + Hardhat).
* Decentralized Storage: Media and metadata stored via IPFS for security and availability.
* Wallet Integration: MetaMask wallet support for authentication, secure transactions, and ownership verification.
* Augmented Reality (AR) Visualization: NFTs can be experienced in AR using Google AR Coreâ€™s Model Viewer.
* Frontend: Built with React.js for user-friendly interactions.

This project demonstrates how blockchain transparency and AR interactivity can create new opportunities in the digital art and collectibles ecosystem.
